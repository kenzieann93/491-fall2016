•	History is always history for someone.  Historiography shows an event/idea can be seen differently among different professions (historians, philosophers, scientists etc.), who then interpret these events.
•	History gives the physical world its meaning, but does not create it.  It is an outside interpretation that can only be constructed from fragments.
•	People with power distribute knowledge, and history helps people create their identities.
•	People tend view history (especially English speakers) as written records and the past itself. This makes the past/history distinction difficult to identify; they are different things, not a pair.
•	The author’s interpretation of a past event can become yours if you only read their writings.  As a reader, you may understand the author more than the historical event.  History can be more faith-based than knowledge-based.
